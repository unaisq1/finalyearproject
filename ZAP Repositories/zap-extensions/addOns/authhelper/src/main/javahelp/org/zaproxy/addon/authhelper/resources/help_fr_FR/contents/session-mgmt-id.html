<H1>Session Management Identification</H1>

This <a href="authhelper.html">add-on</a> includes a passive scan rule which attempts to identify session management methods.<br>
It identifies session management methods by the presence of commonly used session management identifiers 
and any values specified in Authorization request headers.
<p>
The rule will not attempt to identify very unusual session management methods - automation is one of the end goals so false negatives
(missing unusual session management methods) are more desirable than false positives (incorrectly identifying a session management method). 
<p>
If this rule identifies a session management method that is part of the context that you have set to use the
<a href="autodetect-session.html">Auto-Detect Session Management Method</a> then this rule will update the context to use the session management method identified.
<br>
If a session management method is not identified then check to make sure it is made to a site which is included in the context.<br>
If it is not then add the site to the context and authenticate again via your browser.
<p>
The 'Other Info' field is used to report the set of <a href="session-header.html">Header Based Session Management</a>
tokens that need to be specified.
<p>
The rule will currently identify:
<ul>
<li>Header-based session management methods
</ul>

If this rule fails to identify one of the above method then you can raise an 
<a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues">issue</a> with the complete request and response details 
(having obfuscated any sensitive information) and we will investigate it.
