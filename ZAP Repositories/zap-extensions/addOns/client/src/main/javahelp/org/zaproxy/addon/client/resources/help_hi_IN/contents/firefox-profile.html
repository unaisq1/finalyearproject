<H1>Client Side Integration - Firefox Profile</H1>

This <a href="client.html">add-on</a> creates a Firefox profile called 'zap-client-profile' and sets it as the default profile that ZAP will use.
This profile enables the ZAP Firefox extension for all sites.
<p>
If you choose to use another profile then you will need to manually approve the ZAP extension for every
site you use it for, every time you launch a browser from ZAP.
<p>
This is a Firefox restriction - for more details see Bugzilla
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1836309">Bug 183609</a>.

<H2>Custom Containers</H2>

If you want to use the ZAP Firefox extension in your own containers then you may find that it does not work out of the box.
<p>
It should work fine in the <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/">ZAP Docker Images</a> as the 
'zap-client-profile' is added to them.
If you create your own container images then you may need to include it as well.
<p>

<li>The nightly <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile-live">docker build file</a>
