<H1>Client Side Integration - Passive Scan Rules</H1>

The Client Side Integration add-on supports passive scanning of the data streamed from the browser.
<p>
The following rules are included in this add-on:

<H2 id="id-120000">Information Disclosure - Information in Browser Storage</H2>
This rule reports any information stored in browser localStorage and sessionStorage.
<p>
This is not unusual or necessarily unsafe - this informational alerts are raised to help you get a better understanding of 
what this app is doing.
<p>
The alert parameter will be the storage key used.
An alert will only be raised once for each URL + key.

<H2 id="id-120002">Information Disclosure - JWT in Browser Storage</H2>
This rule reports any JWTs stored in browser localStorage and sessionStorage.
<p>
JWTs are commonly stored in sessionStorage so these are just raised as Informational alerts.
<p>
JWTs should not typically be stored in localStorage so these are raised as Medium alerts.
<p>
The alert parameter will be the storage key used.
An alert will only be raised once for each URL + key.
