  - [ ] Update latest ZapVersions file in [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/blob/master/build.gradle.kts)
  - [ ] Release add-ons.
  - [ ] Update main add-ons declared in [main-add-ons.yml](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/main/zap/src/main/main-add-ons.yml):
     - [ ] Add new add-ons.
     - [ ] Remove add-ons no longer needed.
     - [ ] Update add-ons with the task mentioned in `main-add-ons.yml`.
- [ ] Merge the pull request, to create the tag and the draft release (done by [Release Main Version](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/actions/workflows/release-main-version.yml));
- [ ] Verify the draft release.
- [ ] Publish the release.
- [ ] Regenerate and publish the Weekly and Live releases.

Once published the [Handle Release](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/actions/workflows/handle-release.yml) workflow
will trigger the update of the marketplace with the new release, it will also create a pull request preparing the next
development iteration.

### Localized Resources

The resources that require localization (e.g. `Messages.properties`, `vulnerabilities.xml`) are uploaded to the ZAP projects in
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) when the main release is released, if required (for pre-translation) the resources can be uploaded manually
at any time by running the workflow [Crowdin Upload Files](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/actions/workflows/crowdin-upload-files.yml).

The resulting localized resources are added/updated in the repository periodically (through a workflow in the
[zap-admin repository](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/)).

## Weekly Release

The following steps should be followed to release the weekly:
 1. Run the workflow [Release Weekly](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/actions/workflows/release-weekly.yml),
    to create the tag and the draft release;
 2. Verify the draft release;
 3. Publish the release.

Once published the [Handle Release](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/actions/workflows/handle-release.yml) workflow
will trigger the update of the marketplace with the new release.

## Docker Images

The Nightly image is automatically built from the default branch.

The images Weekly, Stable, and Bare are automatically built after the corresponding release to the marketplace.  
The images Stable and Bare are built at the same time.

They can still be manually built by running the corresponding workflow:
 - [Release Weekly Docker](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/actions/workflows/release-weekly-docker.yml)
 - [Release Main (and Bare) Docker](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/actions/workflows/release-main-docker.yml)
